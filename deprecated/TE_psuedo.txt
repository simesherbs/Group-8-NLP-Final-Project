# Step 1: Load the dataset
# Load the corpus of movie synopses and their associated genre tags from a CSV file
LOAD dataset from CSV file (each document has synopses and genre(s))


# Step 3: Extract TF-IDF scores for each term
# Calculate the TF-IDF scores for the entire corpus
INITIALIZE TfidfVectorizer with stopwords (or any other custom settings)
fit and transform the cleaned corpus to obtain the TF-IDF matrix (X_tfidf)

# Step 4: Calculate Chi-square score for each term and genre
# Initialize a dictionary to store chi-square scores for each term for each genre
INITIALIZE empty dictionary chi2_scores for storing chi-square scores
for each term in the vocabulary (from the TF-IDF vectorizer):
    for each genre in the list of genres:
        calculate the chi-square score for this term with respect to the current genre
        store the chi-square score in chi2_scores[term][genre]

# Step 5: Calculate C-values for each term
# C-value measures the importance of terms based on frequency and uniqueness in each genre
INITIALIZE empty dictionary c_values for storing C-values
for each term in the vocabulary:
    calculate the C-value for the term based on its frequency and significance
    store the C-value in c_values[term]

# Step 6: Combine the feature scores for each term and genre
# The final feature score for each term and genre will be a combination of the three scores
INITIALIZE empty dictionary feature_scores to store combined scores for each genre
for each genre in the list of genres:
    for each term in the vocabulary:
        retrieve the TF-IDF score for this term in the current genre (from X_tfidf)
        retrieve the Chi-square score for this term and genre (from chi2_scores)
        retrieve the C-value for this term (from c_values)
        
        # Combine the scores using weighted averaging or any other combination method
        combined_score = (0.5 * tfidf_score) + (0.3 * chi2_score) + (0.2 * c_value)
        
        # Store the combined score in feature_scores[genre][term]
        store combined_score in feature_scores[genre][term]

# Step 7: Output the combined feature scores for each term and genre
for each genre in the list of genres:
    for each term in the vocabulary:
        print "Genre:", genre, "Term:", term, "Combined Score:", feature_scores[genre][term]
